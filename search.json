    "text": "1.1 Strabo: introduction\nWe begin with selections from the Geography of Strabo of Amasia (a town in Asia Minor). Strabo composed his magnum opus in 17 books at around the time of the Emperor Augustus, at the end of the first century BCE and beginning of the first century CE. As was customary with scholarly (and especially with scientific) treatises, Strabo’s programmatic introduction begins by defining the subject matter of his discipline, along with major topics and goals of its study, then systematically reviews the work of his predecessors, especially where, in Strabo’s view, they need correcting. This occupies the first two books of the Geography. Books 3 through 17 then give a description of the inhabited world, moving systematically in a great clockwise sweep from Spain in the west, eastward across Europe and into northern Asia, before finally coming westward back across southern Asia and Africa to the Atlantic coast.\nPerhaps surprisingly to a modern reader, a central question running throughout Strabo’s first two books is whether Homer should be considered a scientific geographer. In the Hellenistic period, the Greek study of geography had been revolutionized, not only by expanded geographic knowledge, but also by the application of scientific mathematical methods. Eratosthenes of Cyrene (in northern Africa) in particular had used geometric calculations to estimate the circumference of the Earth in the third century BCE, and arrived at a figure that would not be rivaled in its accuracy for 2000 years.\nEratosthenes clearly believed that the work of his own generation inaugurated a new scientific kind of study (in Greek, an ἐπιστήμη). His disdain for the view that Homer was the starting point of all knowledge is best illustrated in a memorable one-liner reported by Strabo himself (Strabo 1.2.15):\nStrabo energetically presents the counter argument. (In fact, most of book 2 is given over to a critique of Eratosthenes’ views.) The result is unique in ancient literature: an extended discussion of how to read poetic texts as scholarly works, presented in prose that assiduously adheres to the vocabulary and syntax of contemporary technical writing.",

    "text": "2.1.1 Selections from Strabo book 1, chapter 1\nStrabo 1.1.1-1.1.3\n\n\nτῆς τοῦ φιλοσόφου πραγματείας εἶναι νομίζομεν, εἴπερ ἄλλην τινά, καὶ τὴν γεωγραφικήν, ἣν νῦν προῃρήμεθα ἐπισκοπεῖν.\n\n\n\nτῆς τοῦ φιλοσόφου πραγματείας πραγματεία routinely describes the activity of the scholar; for Strabo, that person is a φιλόσοφος. προῃρήμεθα from προαιρέω (imperfect tense).\n\n\n\n\nὅτι δ’ οὐ φαύλως νομίζομεν ἐκ πολλῶν δῆλον: οἵ τε γὰρ πρῶτοι θαρρήσαντες αὐτῆς ἅψασθαι τοιοῦτοί τινες ὑπῆρξαν, Ὄμηρός τε καὶ Ἀναξίμανδρος ὁ Μιλήσιος καὶ Ἑκαταῖος, ὁ πολίτης αὐτοῦ, καθὼς καὶ ̓Ερατοσθένης φησί: καὶ Δημόκριτος δὲ καὶ Εὔδοξος καὶ Δικαίαρχος καὶ Ἔφορος καὶ ἄλλοι πλείους: ἔτι δὲ οἱ μετὰ τούτους,Ἐρατοσθένης τε καὶ Πολύβιος καὶ Ποσειδώνιος, ἄνδρες φιλόσοφοι.\n\n\n\nδῆλον δῆλον (ἐστί understood). The subject is the entire clause introduced by ὅτι. Ὄμηρός… Ἀναξίμανδρος… Εκαταῖος… Δημόκριτος… Εὔδοξος… Δικαίαρχος… ̓́Εφορος… .̓Ερατοσθένης… Πολύβιος… Ποσειδώνιος a chronologically ordered list of all the major geographers before Strabo – all of them φιλόσοφοι. Strabo will review each in turn in books 1 and 2.\n\n\n\n\nἥ τε πολυμάθεια, δι’ ἧς μόνης ἐφικέσθαι τοῦδε τοῦ ἔργου δυνατόν, οὐκ ἄλλου τινός ἐστιν ἢ τοῦ τὰ θεῖα καὶ τὰ ἀνθρώπεια ἐπιβλέποντος, ὧνπερ τὴν φιλοσοφίαν ἐπιστήμην φασίν.\n\n\n\nδυνατόν δυνατόν (ἐστί understood) οὐκ ἄλλου τινός ἐστιν ἢ “is (a characteristic) of no other person than…”\n\n\n\n\nὡς δ’ αὕτως καὶ ἡ ὠφέλεια ποικίλη τις οὖσα, ἡ μὲν πρὸς τὰ πολιτικὰ καὶ τὰς ἡγεμονικὰς πράξεις, ἡ δὲ πρὸς ἐπιστήμην τῶν τε οὐρανίων καὶ τῶν ἐπὶ γῆς καὶ θαλάττης ζῴων καὶ φυτῶν καὶ καρπῶν καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ὅσα ἰδεῖν παρ’ ἑκάστοις ἔστι, τὸν αὐτὸν ὑπογράφει ἄνδρα, τὸν φροντίζοντα τῆς περὶ τὸν βίον τέχνης καὶ εὐδαιμονίας.\n\n\n\nἡ ὠφέλεια… τὸν αὐτὸν ὑπογράφει ἄνδρα The main subject-verb-object construction expands on the preceding idea: not only is πολυμάθεια characteristic of the philosopher; its usefulness for practical as well as scientific ends “outlines” or “sketches” the same man. ἄνδρα Strabo sees philosophy as a gendered pursuit.\n\n\n\n\nαναλαβόντες δὲ καθ’ ἕκαστον ἐπισκοπῶμεν τῶν εἰρημένων ἔτι μᾶλλον.\n\n\n\nκαθ’ ἕκαστον “Item by item”, “in more detail”. ἐπισκοπῶμεν from ἐπισκοπέω; the indicative would be ἐπισκοποῦμεν. What mood is this?\n\n\n\n\nκαὶ πρῶτον ὅτι ὀρθῶς ὑπειλήφαμεν καὶ ἡμεῖς καὶ οἱ πρὸ ἡμῶν, ὧν ἐστι καὶ ̔́Ιππαρχος, ἀρχηγέτην εἶναι τῆς γεωγραφικῆς ἐμπειρίας ̔́Ομηρον, ὃς οὐ μόνον ἐν τῇ κατὰ τὴν ποίησιν ἀρετῇ πάντας ὑπερβέβληται τοὺς πάλαι καὶ τοὺς ὕστερον, ἀλλὰ σχεδόν τι καὶ τῇ κατὰ τὸν βίον ἐμπειρίᾳ τὸν πολιτικόν,\n\n\n\nὀρθῶς ὑπειλήφαμεν ὀρθῶς is scholarly Greek: it refers to a correct conclusion. (The noun κατόρθωσις is a correction of an error.) ὑπολαμβάνω (perfect active) is a normal verb to mean “taking a position” in a debate. Here it introduces an indiect statement. τῆς γεωγραφικῆς ἐμπειρίας The reader has conceded that geography has both practical benefits as well as purely scientific ones, so Strabo can turn to the founder of geographic experience, Homer. ὃς οὐ μόνον… ὑπερβέβληται Scientific Greek prose can be as challenging as English; this is a massive relative clause. Its verb is ὑπερβέβληται from ὑπερβάλλω. Strabo uses the perfect because references to texts always emphasize their presentness, with either the present tense (“Homer says…”) or as here “Homer has surpassed…” (and the Greek perfect makes clear that we feel the present effect of that excellence). τῇ κατὰ τὸν βίον ἐμπειρίᾳ τῇ ἐμπειρίᾳ is parallel to τῇ ἀρετῇ: no one would contest that Homer surpasses all others in the ἀρετή of his poetry; Strabo add that he is equally supreme in his practical knowledge (ἐμπειρία). Note that parallel attributive expressions with κατά (excellence in poetry paralled by experience in life). τὸν πολιτικόν is in attributive position with τὸν βίον. The word order is not the most common. Is Strabo (playfully?) being just a little poetic in his expression?\n\n\n\n\nἀφ’ ἧς οὐ μόνον περὶ τὰς πράξεις ἐσπούδασεν ἐκεῖνος, ὅπως ὅτι πλείστας γνοίη καὶ παραδώσει τοῖς ὕστερον ἐσομένοις, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ περὶ τοὺς τόπους τούς τε καθ’ ἕκαστα καὶ τοὺς κατὰ σύμπασαν τὴν οἰκουμένην γῆν τε καὶ θάλατταν:\n\n\n\nἀφ’ ἧς The subordination deepens with another relative clause. Antecedent of ἧς is ἐμπειρίᾳ. ὅπως… γνοίη καὶ παραδώσει Textbooks may tell you that ὅπως + optative is normal for purpose expressions after a past-time verb (secondary sequence), and ὅπως + future indicative for primary sequence verbs, but Strabo uses both here. Homer paid serious attention to (human) actions in order to know and understand them (optative γνοίη, a clear echo of the opening lines of the Odyssey); he also strove to transmit these deeds to those still to come. The indicative suggests a more vivid, present image or stronger effort. Homer is an epic poet and historian. (Consult Prof. Joseph on the interaction of these genres in Latin poetry and historiography.) τὴν οἰκουμένην γῆν τε καὶ θάλατταν The proper concern of geography is with the part of the globe that humans inhabit.\n\n\n\n\nοὐ γὰρ ἂν μέχρι τῶν ἐσχάτων αὐτῆς περάτων ἀφίκετο τῇ μνήμῃ κύκλῳ περιιών.\n\n\n\nἂν… ἀφίκετο Aorist indicative from ἀφικνέομαι; apodosis of a past contrafactual condition.\n\n\n\n\nκαὶ πρῶτον μὲν τῷ ὠκεανῷ περίκλυστον, ὥσπερ ἔστιν, ἀπέφαινεν αὐτήν: ἔπειτα δὲ τῶν χωρίων τὰ μὲν ὠνόμαζε τὰ δὲ ὑπῃνίττετο τεκμηρίοις τισί, Λιβύην μὲν καὶ Αἰθιοπίαν καὶ Σιδονίους καὶ ̓Ερεμβούς, οὓς εἰκὸς λέγειν Τρωγλοδύτας ̓́Αραβας, ῥητῶς λέγων, τοὺς δὲ πρὸς ταῖς ἀνατολαῖς καὶ δύσεσιν αἰνιττόμενος ἐκ τοῦ τῷ ὠκεανῷ κλύζεσθαι: ἐντεῦθεν γὰρ ἀνίσχοντα ποιεῖ τὸν ἥλιον καὶ δυόμενον εἰς τοῦτον, ὡς δ’ αὕτως καὶ τὰ ἄστρα καὶ τοὺς ἀστέρας λελουμένους ἐξ ὠκεανοῦ λέγει.\n\n\n\nπερίκλυστον… ἀπέφαινεν αὐτήν Indirect statement; understand εἶναι. The first topic geographers must address is the shape of the inhabitted earth’s forms. ἀνίσχοντα ποιεῖ τὸν ἥλιον… δυόμενον… ὡς δ’ αὕτως καὶ τὰ ἄστρα καὶ τοὺς ἀστέρας λελουμένους… λέγει\n\n\nStrabo 1.1.11:\n\n\nνυνὶ δὲ ὅτι μὲν ̔́Ομηρος τῆς γεωγραφίας ἦρξεν, ἀρκείτω τὰ λεχθέντα. φανεροὶ δὲ καὶ οἱ ἐπακολουθήσαντες αὐτῷ ἄνδρες ἀξιόλογοι καὶ οἰκεῖοι φιλοσοφίας, ὧν τοὺς πρώτους μεθ’ ̔́Ομηρον δύο φησὶν ̓Ερατοσθένης, ̓Αναξίμανδρόν τε Θαλοῦ γεγονότα γνώριμον καὶ πολίτην καὶ ̔Εκαταῖον τὸν Μιλήσιον: τὸν μὲν οὖν ἐκδοῦναι πρῶτον γεωγραφικὸν πίνακα, τὸν δὲ ̔Εκαταῖον καταλιπεῖν γράμμα, πιστούμενον ἐκείνου εἶναι ἐκ τῆς ἄλλης αὐτοῦ γραφῆς.\n\n\n\nἀρκείτω 3rd person imperative. Neuter plural subjects (τὰ λεχθέντα) always take a singular finite form. φανεροὶ… ἀξιόλογοι καὶ οἰκεῖοι φιλοσοφίας Understand εἰσίν. Homer’s immediate followers are conspicuously notable philosophers. ἀξιόλογος (“worth recording”) is an echo of Herotodus; οἰκεῖοι φιλοσοφίας “members of the house of philosophy”. τὸν μὲν… τὸν δὲ Anaximander and Thales are also are the first scholars to tackle the most fundamental jobs of geographic study: creating a graphic model of the earth as a map, and describing the earth in a textual treatise. γράμμα γράμμα and γραφή both derive from γράφω, “mark, draw a line.” γράμμα here refers to a textual document; γραφή is a drawing, or map. A treatise (γράμμα) is attributed to Hecataeus because of its resemblance to his second or subsequent map (τῆς ἄλλης γραφῆς) after Anaximander.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "3.1 The Guide to the Inhabited World: an introduction\nOur second text is a hexameter poem of fewer than 1200 lines that in our manuscripts commonly has the title Περιήγησις τῆς οἰκουµένης, “Guide to the inhabited world.” Its vocabulary and forms draw heavily on epic predecessors, and the poet, who speaks to us in first person, characterizes his work as epic. (Note in selection 1 the verb ἀείδειν; the address to the Muses in selection 2; the closing wish that he will receive a fair reward for his divinely inspired song, in selection 4.)\nThe poem’s content, on the other hand, strictly follows a sequence of topics that is conventional in geographic treatises, and even reports dissenting scholarly views on geographic topics. The Περιήγησις τῆς οἰκουµένης is a significant example of a distinctive feature of ancient scholarship: the composition of introductory textbooks in the form of didactic poetry. (The most famous example of this genre is Aratus’ Phaenomena: we plan to look at the Greek text and perhaps a Latin translation of Aratus later in the semester.)\nThis probably allows us to identify the author with an article in the marvelous tenth century encyclopedia known as the Suda. Entry delta 1173, with English translation by David Whitehead, reads:\nThe continued interest in the poem is clear from a variety of evidence. Approximately 150 Greek manuscripts survive, many including scholia. By the ninth or tenth century, the poem could be accompanied by a prose paraphrase to make Dionysius’ work accessible to readers who might struggle with some of the archaisms in his poetic language. At the other extreme, the great Byzantine scholar Eustathius produced an extensive commentary on it in the twelfth century CE.\nThere were multiple Latin translations over the centuries, including extant translations by Rufius Festus Avienius (fourth century CE), Priscian (beginning of sixth century CE), an anonymous translation of the twelfth century CE, and various Renaissance translations. In the sixth century CE, Cassiodorus advised all the monks in his monastery known as the Vivarium to read the poem.\nFinally a note on terminology. Περιήγησις was generically used as a title for works on geography, but just as scholars could refer to Homer simply as ὁ ποιητής without further elaboration, the phrase ὁ περιγητής is used unambiguously to refer to one person: Dionysius was the perigete.",

The multiple direct objects of ἀείδειν (γαῖάν…πόντον…ποταμοὺς…πόλιάς…ἀνδρῶν φῦλα) not only define the scope of geography but define a traditional sequence of topics: primary (πόντον) and secondary (ποταμοὺς) physical features, followed by human settlements.\n\n\n\n\n3 μνήσομαι Ὠκεανοῖο βαθυρρόου· ἐν γὰρ ἐκείνῳ\n\n\n\nμνήσομαι future of μιμνήσκω, constructed with a genitive object.\n\n\n\n\n4 πᾶσα χθὼν, ἅτε νῆσος ἀπείριτος, ἐστεφάνωται,\n\n\n\nἀπείριτος “boundless” is a compound (the first letter is the “alpha privative” that negates the sense of the root adjective), and therefore has only only two sets of forms for common gender (masculine or feminine) and neuter. ἐστεφάνωται irregular perfect stem from στεφανόω.\n\n\n\n\n5 οὐ μὲν πᾶσα διαπρὸ περίδρομος, ἀλλὰ διαμφὶς\n\n\n\nπερίδρομος Another compound adjective.\n\n\n\n\n6 ὀξυτέρη βεβαυῖα πρὸς ἠελίοιο κελεύθους,\n\n\n\nβεβαυῖα epic perfect participle from βαίνω. ἠελίοιο epic stem for ἥλιος; epic -οιο is a regular genitive singular ending for second declension masculines.\n\n\n\n\n7 σφενδόνῃ εἰοικυῖα· μίαν δέ ἑ καίπερ ἐοῦσαν\n\n\n\nεἰοικυῖα here in the literal sense “to resemble, seem like, the verb ἔοικα is only used in the perfect tense. ἑ epic form of the third person pronoun, common gender, accusative singular.\n\n\n\n\n8 ἄνθρωποι τρισσῇσιν ἐπ’ ἠπείροισι δάσαντο·\n\n\n\nτρισσῇσιν, ἠπείροισι epic endings for dative plural. ἤπειρος is the technical term for “continent” in geographic writing.
